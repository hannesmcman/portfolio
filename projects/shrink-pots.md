Shrink pots are as fun make as they are useful around the house. Depending on their size, these wooden pots can be used to store baking ingredients like salt or flour, wooden spoons, pens, and more!

Simple in construction, shrink pots consist of a hollowed out branch or piece of trunk with a base fitted into the bottom. But how does one ensure a tight fit for the base?

In order to get a tight fit for the base, it must be fit into the body of the shrink pot when the piece of wood used for the body is still quite green, or moist. Using this technique, the dry base can be fitted quite loosely at first. The fit will then tighten over the following days/weeks as the radius of hte circular body of the pot shrinks! Hence the name: shrink pot.
