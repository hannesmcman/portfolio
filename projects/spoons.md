title: 'spoons!'

My passion for slöjd started with a spoon. [This spoon](/assets/img/first_spoon.jpg), actually. 

It was my first project for the 'Scandinavian Woodworking' class I had signed up for on a whim in my last semester of undergrad. I had no notion that this spoon would be the first of many - that I would soon struggle to return to a world filled with the harsh sound of metal spoons scraping the bottom of a cereal bowl.

Suffice to say, I love making spoons. 

I see them as an ideal entrypoint for the budding slöjd enthusiast as they can be carved anywhere one can sit down, are enjoyable to use in everyday life, and require the use of only three tools: hatchet, slöjd knife, and hook knife. 

The following spoons have been shaped through the combined efforts of myself and an ever-growing community of trees.
