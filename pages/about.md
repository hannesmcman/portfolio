# about

The items on this site have been shaped through the combined efforts of myself and an ever-growing community of trees. It is truly a collaborative process as each tree emerges from the ground, reaching toward the sun in her own way. First a trunk, often made of straight-grained fibers taking the shortest path toward their life source. Then come the branches, bending and reaching through curved fibers to forge their own way to the light. 

Then it is my turn. Following the mantra of Jogge Sundqvist ("Form follows Fibers"), I follow the fibers toward the final shape of whatever item is to be found.
